## Built Using

This is my attempt to build a Tetris Clone using strictly HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

[Live Demo](https://ihjacobs925.github.io/Tetris-Game/)

## How to Play

1. You may choose to fork and clone this repo or click on the Live Demo to launch the game in your browser.
2. To move the active randomized game piece use the left or the right arrow keys.
3. To soft drop the piece, use the down arrow key.
4. To rotate the piece, use the up arrow key.
5. Mobile gameplay is not optimized as of this moment, but on devices less than 768px,
4 buttons will appear to control the piece. The buttons are marked by arrows pointing left, right, down and clockwise.
6. Other buttons included and can be found on the panel are pause/play and restart.

### Scores | Levels
1. High Scores will be stored in your local storage
2. The game is over when your piece locks at the top of the board.
3. Game level as well as the score go up by clearing a certain number of lines.
4. At each level the speed at which the pieces drop will increase.

### Point System

 - Single = 40 Pts x Level
 - Double = 100 Pts x Level
 - Triple = 300 Pts x Level
 - Tetris = 1200 Pts x Level
